# Csek Rebrand Theme

## Authors

## Description

The goal of this theme is to make use of modern Gutenberg features to create a highly customizable theme that can be used for a variety of purposes.

The initial scope of this project will be limited to the Fall 2023 rebrand of Csek Creative. The theme will be built to be used on the Csek Creative website, but will (hopefully) be built in a way that it can be easily repurposed for other projects, representing a significant improvement over the current Csek Creative theme.

## Credits

This theme is a modified version of Tailpress by [Jeffrey van Rossum](https://vanrossum.dev/).
